# Sourcemod-Plugins

This repository hosts plugins I made for sourcemod alongside the source code. I included heavy documentation so everybody can learn and develop plugins. I update this repository from time to time and I keep adding more plugins to it. These plugins are well tested so bugs should be non-existent, but I could've messed something up so let me know if you find anything.
