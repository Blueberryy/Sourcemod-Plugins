# Sourcemod-Plugins

 This repository contains the plugins I made for sourcemod and also the source code. I added heavy documentary to each source file so it helps everyone to create plugins. I'll update this repository from time to time and include my other plugins. I have heavily tested these products so bugs should be non-existent, however, I could've still missed something so please send me feedback and bug reports to help keep these working.
